# Book

The project is part of React Nanodegree graduation requirements. The app is divided into two pages home page holds three shelves currently reading, want to read, and read. users are able to move books between them in addition, there is a link to the search page. users also can search for books and add them to the desired shelf. and in turn, they can go to shelves again by the provided link.

- built search functionality by consuming search API endpoint
- Ensured the app doesn't break if the book list not returned
